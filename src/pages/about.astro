      Amphora is an archive of attempts at understanding the XXIst Century
      transition from a post-World War II arrangement of geopolitical landscape,
      into a new era rife with existential question marks, "memeified" global
      culture, and an out of kilter human hierarchy of needs, pursued not
      through hard labor and the beauty of tradition, but by the swift
      relativization and commodification of the evolving mores of an
      increasingly heterogeneous, albeit contentious social gamut. Amphora is an
      archive of attempts at understanding the XXIst Century transition from a
      post-World War II arrangement of geopolitical landscape, into a new era
      rife with existential question marks, "memeified" global culture, and a
      seemingly out of kilter human hierarchy of needs, pursued not through hard
      labor and the beauty of tradition, but by the swift relativization and
      commodification of the evolving mores of an increasingly heterogeneous,
      albeit contentious social gamut. Whether humanity transitions towards a
      reliable, fully automated infrastructure (even if bereft of a sense of
      life meaning), a new techno-feudal system, or a libertine,
      dopamine-depleted population, the first half of the 2000s has and will
      likely continue to be defined by the rise of the infinite stream of
      consumption-inducing media, with its deleterious effects on the collective
      understanding of social roles, political leniency, and individual
      identity. It is not the case that these civilizational dynamics appear out
      of the blue with the inception of digital technology. For one,
      consumerism, as a fact of human interaction, not the over-extended form of
      social status one-upmanship or rent-seeking, likely was well underway as
      an adaptation to a scarcity-based economy since before we were "thinking
      men" (Homo sapiens). Trade is a natural result of the most primitive form
      of reason, the kind insightful enough to anticipate what occurs when a
      lonely, hungry, in search or defense of a mate or litter, or otherwise
      fearful living being gets to maximal desperation, or even, minimal
      anxiety. No, the digital age does not bring the natural interplay of
      negotiating primates from basic barter to full-blown economic
      philosophies, nor does it make the average media consumer enraged with
      unfounded or incomplete ideas about their fellow neighbors. The World was
      far from tolerant, rational, or balanced by the end of the 20th Century.
      It does however, amplify our emotional tendencies and intellectual
      vulnerabilities. The blind spots we all have are easily exploited through
      a barrage of news, stunts, opinion and publicity, all carefully designed
      to elicit a consumptive (destructive) reaction. In 2024, it is safe to say
      creating addicting reactivity loops is all but a feature. Every flaw and
      negative reaction is now being magnified to its most extreme version to
      date, not to mention massively distributed. Everything said is recorded.
      Every mistake filmed. Every error of judgment registered as if suddenly
      trial and error, the optimization of thought, the reconciling of novel and
      apparently antagonistic ideas were not a possibility in the human
      experiment. Not only is this damaging to an open society, it is patently
      opposed to how progress is actually made. One need not take a hard look at
      sciences like neuro-biology, music genres such as rock-fusion, or even the
      notion that minimal good character is not reserved to one gender or
      another, to realize synthesis is the engine of progress. And while
      technology has historically been the gate to human betterment, it is the
      openness of its users that constitutes its key.
